By using this site, you agree to:

## 1. Our Almighty Authority

- You accept these terms by blinking. Blink twice if you’re in distress.
- You forfeit your firstborn child* (*metaphorically… probably).

## 2. Prohibited Activities

Do NOT use this site to:

- Harpoon our servers with malware.
- Summon eldritch horrors (unless they buy merch).

## 3. Disclaimers

- Accuracy: Our content is 10% fact, 90% wishful thinking.
- Uptime: We’re online roughly as often as your Wi-Fi during a thunderstorm.
- Outcomes: Using this site won’t make you rich, famous, or interesting. Results may include falling into the rabbit hole.

## 4. Liability

We’re not responsible for:

- Your life choices: Including impulse purchases of FlaVR merch.
- Third-party links: Click at your own risk. We’re not your internet babysitter.
- The apocalypse: Unless it’s caused by our code. Then… maybe?

## 5. Amendments

We’ll change these terms whenever we feel like it. Updates will be posted in size 2 font on a subpage titled “Oops.” Continued use = consent. Resistance is futile.
